Mythic Engine is Mythic's implementation of Apple's game porting toolkit (GPTK), which combines [wine](https://www.winehq.org/) and Apple D3DMetal, to create a windows gaming experience on macOS. Similar to Proton, Mythic Engine attempts to be a emulator-like (remember, [Wine Is Not an Emulator](https://www.winehq.org/about) experience that enables native Windows games to be playable on macOS, while coming closer to native performance than ever before. (performance will vary between games)
